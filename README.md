## Projects
### Lightning Web Components Showcase
- Description: Sure, your organization previously used a messy system of emailing spreadsheets for travel approvals. There was no central place to track or enforce the process, making it impossible to report on travel approvals across the company. Now, the plan is to build a custom travel approval app to address these issues and create a smoother, trackable process.
